# Taming Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis

# Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the paper "Taming Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis" by [Authors' Names]. The project aims to explore the use of transformers for high-resolution image synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art results in the field.

# Motivation
Traditional image synthesis methods rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to generate images. However, these methods often struggle to produce high-resolution images with complex structures. Transformers, on the other hand, have shown great success in natural language processing tasks, but their application to image synthesis has been limited. This project aims to bridge this gap by adapting transformers for high-resolution image synthesis.

# Methodology
The proposed method consists of two main components:

# Transformer Encoder:
A transformer encoder is used to process the input noise vector and generate a feature map. The encoder is composed of multiple layers, each consisting of a self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward network.
# Image Synthesis:
The feature map generated by the encoder is then used to generate an image. This is done by applying a series of upsampling and convolutional operations to the feature map.
# Implementation Details
The project is implemented using PyTorch.
The transformer encoder is based on the original transformer architecture, with some modifications to accommodate the image synthesis task.
The image synthesis module is implemented using a combination of PyTorch's nn.Upsample and nn.Conv2d modules.
The project uses the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 16.
